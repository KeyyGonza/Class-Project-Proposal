<p>Some moods include, happy, love, sad, and chill. Allowing the user to explore new artist and songs.</p>
<p>When pressing the song link, it will lead to Youtube in order to listen to the song. </p>
<p>The Quiz allows users to answer 6 questions and in the end, they will be given a list of K-pop groups that match what they answered</p>

<p>Using selection coding to enhance the website </p>

<h2> Advanced Technical Features </h2>
<p>Allowing the user to have a new playlist everytime they press the mood button.  </p>

<h2> Discussion 6 Improvement </h2>
<p>My teammates have thought about downloading the songs or more randomized songs </p>

 <h2>Requirement 1 </h2>

<p> </p>
 <h2>Requirement 2 </h2>

<p> The Quiz website was similarly to Sprint 4. With the help of the previous coding, I was able to do this website.  </p>
<p>Previous project was also helpful to create the css. Things like changing the colors and implementing jpg</p>
<p>Previous projects I was able to learn how to create buttons which I was able to use for this project. </p>
<p>Also in spring 1, I was able to learn how to add links so the user can press and it sends them to the link, I used the same method to add the youtube videos.</p>

 <h2>Requirement 3 </h2>

<p>A majority of this project was things of greater in complexity. For example, the youtube thumbnail being shown in the webiste so the user can press on it to get send to the Youtube link </p>
<p>Another thing was adding the heart rating system and be able to calculate what percentage of users rate each heart</p>
 <h2>Requrement 4 <h2>
   <p> I was able to complete my feauture list. Adding a heart system so users can rate the song, be able to see a preview of the YouTube thumbnail and press on it </p>
<p>Something I didn't add to my proposal but still added is a short summary of who the artist/group is, when they debuted, and their success.</p>
